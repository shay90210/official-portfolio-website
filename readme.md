# Official Portfolio Website

## This portfolio website is my official professional website that I market to future/prospective employers. 

### Why a portfolio website?

- It is extremely important for me to showcase my talent that I have been working on the past 7 months. The completed projects that will display on my portfolio show my strengths as a developer as well as my dedication and passion. This portfolio was created through watching a tutorial from freecodecamp.org via YouTube. This project will incoporate primarily JavaSCript and SASS. HTML will be used for simply formatting sections.
